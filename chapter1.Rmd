# Paula's thoughts about...
## the course 

I was really glad to find out about this doctoral course provided by Helsinki University. If I recall correctly, this was the result of the great work of the doctoral office and their kind (daily) emails promoting available and upcoming courses.

I am a third year doctoral student and very much into statistics. Despite my colleagues who hate it. Because of my enthusiasm, I took this course even though I constantly struggle to manage with scheduling my studies and working (as an MD). I also have kids I should pay some attention to. I have, however, promised to buy a dog for them once my PhD is finished so I'm not in any hurry here, haha.

I enjoy the opportunity to study things online (whenever I have some free time!) and this course seems REALLY well organized in that regard. So thanks in advance. I hope I manage to get this first week's assignment done in time, I hate receiving zero points. I'm also sorry for the students that have the dishonor to review my output this week as it may not be very glamorous. My apologies.

I expect my learn new and foremost **faster** and more efficient ways to use R. I was also surprised to hear about automated reports - that sounds fantastic (I think my supervisors would agree).

## the R for Health Data Science book and the Exercise Set 1

All the materials provided in the moodle environment are easy to read and greatly written! I guess taking this course now (not earlier, before any "real life statistical needs") is more beneficial for me than if I had participated earlier â€“ even though now as I'm going through the course material, I realize I would have saved several hours of work had I known these things earlier. But it's always better late than never, right? 

As I have worked with R before, the first chapters in the RHDS book sounded familiar. However, I learned that search engines prefer "older" scripts over new ones, building the results upon the inverted pyramid of information, I quess. This is good to know. I quess R programming language will evolve in time like any "human" language! In a couple of thousand years, nobody understands any "pipes"... Brouching through the book and excercise set 1 I already came across answers (=script) for some issues I have had previously working with R. For example, how to handle missing data (NAs) in R properly. This almost brought tears to my weary eyes. So, this truly is a "crash course"! 

Getting started with R Markdown was executed so sneakily I didn't ever realize I started using it. Untill I did, and then started wondering if the package for R markdown was to be downloaded first..?
